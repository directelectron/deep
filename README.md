# DEEP Format
Detected Electron Event Puddle (DEEP) Format

The detected electron event puddle (DEEP) data format is a binary representation of the signal generated by single electron detection events.
Unlike the electron event representation (EER) and ReCoDe L4-compression formats, the DEEP format includes each detection eventâ€™s shape and intensity information.
Unlike the ReCoDe L1-compression format, the DEEP format groups pixel information into individual electron detection events instead of simply encoding all non-zero pixel intensities in a raster format for each frame.

For a detailed description of the format, please see DEEPSpecification.pdf.
